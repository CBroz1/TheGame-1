Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where friends tell a collaborative narrative story together. This guide is enough to get started, but we recommended you read the Full Players Guide to learn all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices. Quick-Start Guide Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part. The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant. The Deck Grab a deck of playing cards , reserving the Jokers, and shuffle well. Cards will be drawn from this deck and make their way to a Discard Pile. Checks If your character attempts an action with an unknown outcome, you'll be asked to make a Check , which involves drawing one more cards from your deck, and comparing the outcome via... A Target Card (TC) that is drawn and shown on the table, which you hope to Draw a value close to in order to succeed on your Check. Think of it as the bullseye of the target you are aiming for. Difficulty Range (DR) that defines how far away from the TC you can be and still succeed. Think of it as the closest rings surrounding the bullseye. A DR 'above' a King is an Ace, then 2, and so on. A DR 'below' 2 is an Ace, then King, etc. A Modifier (Mod) provided by your character sheet, that allows you to add or subtract from the card you draw to get closer to the TC. This helps you aim your Check closer to the bullseye. Under some circumstances, you'll be asked to draw with the Upper Hand or the Lower Hand. With the Upper Hand, you can draw an additional card(s) and use the more favorable value to increase your odds. With the Lower Hand, you must draw an additional card(s) and use the less favorable value, decreasing your odds. A single instance of Upper Hand or Lower Hand requires you to draw just 1 additional card. However, these effects can compound, requiring you to draw 2 or more cards for the applicable check. Upper and Lower Hand can also cancel each other out. For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5 to succeed on a Check. If you have a +1 Mod, you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a successful 3 or 5 draw. Fate Cards You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as Fate Cards . Any Aces drawn during play are also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and take the new value, you can discard a Fate Card to regenerate one Fate Point , or you can discard a Fate Card during combat to nullify one damage. Characters You will have a Character Sheet with all the information about your character. This includes Attributes (general skills, like Agility and Intelligence), and specific Skills under each attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility). Each Attribute and Skill has a Modifier that you add when performing a Check related to that Attribute or Skill, signified by a number like +1. Also on your character sheet are Powers . This is anything your character can do that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or 2 Fate Points respectively to activate. Your character sheet shows your starting number of Fate Points as your maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many Fate Points you have left as you use Powers. Gameplay Throughout a session, your GM will describe scenes and may provide visual cues or props. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure out what your character would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact rules) is encouraged. The GM might announce an Epic Event , a series of trials in a tense scenario. The GM will reveal a TC and DR. One or more players can volunteer and decide the relevant check. Each player and the GM will take turns drawing on the TC to get a success with a matching suit. Each TC is a collective success or failure. Resting Your character may need to rest to recharge Fate Points or heal Health Points. On a Quick Rest (30 minutes), each player can draw a number of Rest Cards . Each Rest Card can regain 1 Health or Fate Point, or be used to regain Armor Points. If the card drawn is the same as the character's Primary Suit, there are additional benefits. Reference the Full Guide for more details on taking a Quick Rest. On a Full Rest you replenish all expended Health, Fate, and Armor. If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may shuffle, but must always draw with Lower Hand (1+) until your next Rest. This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day. Return all Aces to the deck, and Jokers to your hand and shuffle . Some GMs may also ask for shuffling on Quick Rests. Combat If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning of Combat, where each involved character will draw a Target Card to determine turn order. On your turn, you can move and take up to 1 Major and 1 Minor Action, in any order. Minor actions include object interactions and some Skill Checks. Your movement is limited by the Speed value on your character sheet, showing the maximum number of spaces you can move on a grid. The average speed is 6. Your character sheet will give you optional actions that you can take listed under Powers, but you can always try something new. Ask your GM if your idea is possible under circumstances. If you get hit, you can expend a Fate card to nullify 1 point of damage. Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to undo this effect. For a full list of effects and their rules, consult the Full Players Guide. Have Fun! You're now ready to play your first game of Deck of Adventures! Remember: having fun comes first.","title":"Brief Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Brief/#deck-of-adventures-core-mechanics","text":"","title":"Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Brief/#what-is-deck-of-adventures","text":"Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where friends tell a collaborative narrative story together.

A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player\u2019s success and failure, and guides the group in a meaningful way. Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things. Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards. While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action, Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck. Guiding Principles In times of uncertainty, defer to the following: Have fun. The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to ensure the entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and will work to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up. The Action Deck Deck of Adventures is based around a 54-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A) across 4 suits, as well as Jokers. Each player should have their own Deck. Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a Check, which means drawing from their respective decks to help determine the outcome. Jokers and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, for both players and the GM. All other cards go directly into a Discard Pile. Hold on to these Fate Cards, even when shuffling the deck. Players will use their deck to do most anything; it represents their character's stamina until they complete a Rest. When the Action Deck is empty and a player has to shuffle between rests, they draw with the Lower Hand (1+) until they would shuffle when resting. Fate Cards Fate Cards (Jokers and Aces) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player to choose when they want a second chance at a key moment. After a Full Rest, Jokers return to the player's hand as Fate Cards, if they're not there already. Aces drawn from the deck are played as usual, but remains in the player's hand as a Fate Card. Any time a player or the GM draws a card, they may discard one held Fate Card and redraw. Only one redraw is permitted per check. Fate Cards may also be expended to either ... Toughen Up : ignore damage equal to the number of Fate Cards used. This must be done before the end of the Player's next turn after recieving damage. Exchange Fate : gain Fate Points equal to the number of Fate Cards used. A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the player's discard pile or signified by another token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character\u2019s strengths or weaknesses. Characters Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality. Skills are specific to an Attribute. These signify how good a character is at performing certain types of actions. Each Skill is tied to an Attribute, meaning improving that Attribute also increases the effectiveness of a related Skill. Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a Conviction skill. All Attributes and Skills are listed below. Modifiers reflect a character\u2019s level of expertise given Attribute or Skill domain and allow you to add or subtract your draw before reporting the value on a given check. These modifiers are determined at Character Creation and can be improved as you Level Up. Complete Attribute and Skill List: Agility AGL Finesse (Fight) Stealth Conviction CON Bluffing Performance Intuition GUT Detection Craft Intelligence INT Knowledge Investigation Strength STR Athletics Brute (Fight) Vitality VIT Each skill is generally related to a domain of expertise a character may possess. A GM might call for a Check using a specific Skill, but you can always ask if another would be applicable in the situation. The GM decides whether the Skill applies, so get creative! Dealers, Bystanders and Companions The Player Characters (PCs) are typically the heroes of the story. PCs are considered Dealers and differ from the majority of other characters in the world. The GM may control other Dealers who can take the form of powerful allies or adversaries the players may encounter along the way. Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters that are controlled by the Game Master. They... Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities. Have at least 5 health points (HP). Draw from their own deck of cards. Can receive and use Fate Cards. Have a Primary Suit, and related mechanics. Bystanders. All other characters. They... Are weaker than Dealers Have limited access to Powers Have 1-3 HP. Draw from a collective set of cards controlled by the GM. Cannot use either Fate Cards or Primary Suit features. Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or other-worldly advisor. A Companion acts on the players turn, draws from the Dealer's deck of cards, and grants unique features in and out of combat. See the setting Bestiary for a list of potential Companions and their unique features. Playing the Game Exploration and Adventuring The players are creating and experiencing the world at the same time. Adventures can include exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging in social interactions with other players and non-playable characters. During an Adventure, the GM will ask players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier relevant to the circumstance. Setting the Scene. The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players are encouraged to ask clarifying questions. What do I see? Characters often know more just by having direct access to the world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a character might have. The GM\u2019s answer may depend on a successful check. Talking to the Locals. The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse to be rude to one\u2019s fellow players. Making a Check When the GM or a Player calls for a Check, they announce who will be making this check and reveal (a) a Target Card (TC), (b) the Attribute or Skill associated with the check, and (c) the Difficulty Range (DR). A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like the circles around the bullseye. Once the DR has been announced, players must make this check. Players may consult with their GM to determine if another Attribute or Skill may be used instead. A player will draw one or more cards. Immediately after drawing, a player will apply any relevant Modifiers before reporting the outcome and whether or not they have successfully fallen within the DR. A Modifier is the maximum value a player may add or subtract; this is usually done to get closer to the TC. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet next to the relevant Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a character's ability to 'aim' a check to get closer to the TC. The GM may describe the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success and ask the player to describe how their character successfully accomplishes the action. Because the range of cards is circular (Q, K, A, 2, 3, etc.), success is all about dialing in your effort to match the task at hand as closely as possible. Remembering which card is 5 below a 3 can be tough, so there is a table below as well as a printable tool to help look up the DR range as you get familiar with the system. Target Card Range Table For each card on the left, refer to the column with the corresponding DR. Left of 0 is the lower bound, right of 0 is the upper bound. TC -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 A 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J 6 K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q 7 A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 10 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 J 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 Q 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 K 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 Degrees of Success Exactly matching the TC in numeric value, is a Major Success. If the drawn card is a perfect match (i.e., value and suit), it's a Critical Success. If the card drawn is within the DR and matches the suit or color (i.e., red/black), it is either a Suited or Color Success. If there is a suit or color match outside the DR after the modifier has been applied, this is a Suited or Color Miss. Suit and Color will only matter under specific circumstances; for certain character Powers, item types or defenses. There is no critical failure in Deck of Adventures. For example , when Xena attempts to jump across a chasm, the GM reveals a TC of the 8 of Clubs and a DR of 2, asking for an Athletics check. If the player's Athletics modifier is +1, the check is ... A Critical Success if they draw the 8 of Clubs. They might perfectly make the jump, impressing their allies, and catch a glimpse of something important in the distance. A Major Success if they draw any 8. They might make the jump gracefully enough to impress their allies without any other perks. A Success if they draw any card within 3 (DR 2 \u00b1 1 Mod). For TC 8, DR 1, and Mod 1, this is 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 or J. If Xena draws a J, they may subtract 1 to report a 10, within the DR. A Color Success for any Successes that match the color of the TC. A Suited Success for any Successes that match the Suit of the TC. Xena might have a Power that grants benefits to allies on a Suited Success. After crossing, they can improve their ally's chances of crossing. A Suited or Color Miss if they draw any Club or Spade, respectively below 5 or above J. Xena might have a Power that lets them redraw on a Suited Miss, for example. A Miss is any Diamond or Heart draw below 5 or above J. Upper and Lower Hand Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you. Having the Upper Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card closest to the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A player may choose to stop drawing before N cards are drawn. Having the Lower Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card that is furthest from the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A play must draw all N cards. In these cases, the other card is discarded. If N is not specified, draw 1 extra. Multiple Upper/Lower hand effects can compound or even out. If a rule specifies Upper/Lower Hand (N+), the effect can apply multiple times. N cards are drawn, +1 for each instance the effect is applied. For example, running through your Action Deck without resting is Lower Hand (1+). This means that, if it happens twice, draw 3. If another effect would also cause drawing with Lower Hand, draw 4. Contested Checks Some checks will be initiated by a character's actions and require others to respond, pitting two skills against each other. This might be one character sneaking past another (e.g., Stealth vs. Detection), or one character causing a magical effect that another tries to dodge (e.g., Craft vs. Agility). This is a Contested Check. In these cases, the character who initiated the action (i.e., the Attacker) reveals a TC and sets the DR; the DR for a Contested Check is 3 minus half of the Attacker's relevant modifier, to a minimum of 0. The character(s) responding are the Target(s). Rules that describe a \"Contested X Check vs. Y\" use the attacker's Skill X and Targets' Y. Targets succeed or fail individually. For example, Xena attempts to convince Jonas of something (either truthfully or with deception), they would use their Bluffing Mod of +1, setting the DR to 3 (4-1). They draw a TC of 3 of Diamonds, permitting a card between A and 6. Jonas draws an 8 of Spades with a +1 Modifier to Detection and reports a 7, still outside the DR. Xena would successfully convince Jonas of something in this scenario. In Combat Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. The GM decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. Combat in Deck of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while leaving a lot of room for player teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players should be sure to study their character sheets and know their options ahead of combat, and use others\u2019 turns to make their choices. Deck of Adventures is all about teamwork, so communication is encouraged. GMs may provide a grid map and other visual cues like character tokens to help players visualize the situation. On a square grid, moving diagonally counts as one space unless otherwise ruled by the GM. In combat, a Critical Success has an additional effect. Damaging or Healing actions deal or return 1 additional damage to the target. Other actions will grant benefits at the GM's discretion. Taking Turns Combat order is determined by card draw. At the beginning of combat, all characters draw a Target Card and place it in on the table in view. The values represent the turn order (Ace first, then K, Q, etc.) and the TC for any attack. Players with the same Target Card values as an enemy go first. If two players draw the same Target Card, they can decide who goes first. Without consensus, the player with the higher Agility modifier goes first. A player may delay their turn in initiative order to intentionally occur before or after another player(s)', but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their action(s) by the end of the round. A GM may skip a player\u2019s turn if they are unprepared and need more time to think. In Combat Actions Each turn represents 6 seconds of game time passing. On a turn, a character may (a) move, (b) perform 1 Major Action, and/or (c) perform 1 Minor Action in any order they choose. They may also perform any number of Free Actions, within reason, as permitted by the GM. Movement By default, character speed is equal to 6, but may be faster or slower. Speed is the total number of spaces a character can move in a turn. This total may be split to occur before, after, and/or between actions. Actions The list below are possible Minor/Major Actions, but a GM may permit others. If an action specifies a skill, this requires a check. Free - Communication that does not require a check. - Observation : gaining obvious information about the world. - Toughening Up : discard one or more Fate Cards to nullify one damage per card used. - Exchanging Fate : discard one or more Fate Cards to gain one Fate Point per card used. Minor - Object interaction : Pressing a button, pulling a lever, using a disposable item, etc. - Inspect : Detection or Investigation vs. GM-determined DR; learn something about an opponent or the terrain. - Convince : Bluffing vs. GM-determined DR; convince a target to change their course of action - Recall : Knowledge vs. GM-determined DR; determine if a character knows a specific piece of information Major - Rush : double movement - Grapple : Brute vs. target Finesse or Brute; cause one creature to be entangled - Hide : Stealth vs. target(s) Detection; impose Lower Hand on attacks against you by target(s) who failed Status Conditions Some Status Conditions will impact a character over time. The duration of each Condition is listed in the Power or effect that causes it. Stunned If a Dealer is hit by a critical attack, they make a DR 3 Conviction Check at the start of their turn vs their own TC. If failed, they may either move or make one Action on their turn, not both. Some creatures can cause the Stunned Condition as part of their attacks. Entangled A Dealer may expend a Major Action to make a DR 3 Strength check. Until they are successful, they may not move and any Agility Checks are made with Lower Hand. Knocked Down A Dealer must expend a Minor Action to get up. Their movement speed is halved, rounding up. All Strength and Agility Checks are made with Lower Hand. When Knocked Down, attackers within 1 space draw with Upper Hand and attackers further than 1 space away draw with Lower Hand. Blinded, Deafened At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a DR 3 Intuition Check vs. their TC. If they fail, they draw Lower Hand (3) for any action requiring the relevant sense. Knocked Out Knocked Out (KO) Dealers are unable to act until treated by a Craft check or a Healing Power (DR 5 vs. the KO Dealer's TC, minus 1 for each turn passed since the effect onset). If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, the player begins an Epic Event alone. Burned As a Minor Action, a Dealer can make a DR 3 Intuition check to stop the burning. On a failure, they take 1 damage bypassing AP. Poisoned At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a DR 3 Vitality Check to shake off the effects of the poison. On a failure, they take 1 damage bypassing AP. Frozen Movement speed is reduced by half and all skill checks are drawn at Lower Hand. A Dealer makes a DR 3 Strength Check as a Free Action at the end of their turn to attempt to end the freeze. Health and Armor Dealers have 4 health points (HP) plus their level, plus Vitality modifier. The health of Companions HP is half the level of their Dealer, rounding up. If a character is wounded beyond their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor Points (AP) are an additional resource that would be removed first in the event of a physical wound. Armor Range (AR) is how hard you are to hit in general and sets the DR for an attack against you. Without armor, this is 3 minus half of your Agility modifier rounded down. If you have physical armor or an armor-like magical effect, this determines your AR depending on the type of armor. Some armor has strength requirements which, if unmet, will cut a character's speed in half. Some armor can possess special effects, like granting bonuses to certain checks or requiring hits to color-match. Physical shields and magical effects can grant AP, either when equipping the item or activating the Power. Unless otherwise specified, damage subtracts from AP first. After AP is depleted, additional damage subtracts from HP. Unless otherwise noted, no two pieces of armor may be worn at the same time. Armor Table | Type | AR | AP | Prerequisite | |-----------|----|----|---------------| | Basic | 3 | 0 | | | Light | 3 | 0 | | | Medium | 2 | 0 | | | Fortified | 2 | 1 | Strength \u2265 0 | | Heavy | 1 | 2 | Strength \u2265 1 | | Massive | 1 | 3 | Strength \u2265 2 | | Gleaming | 1 | 2 | Agility \u2265 3 | Epic Events At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event. The GM will narrate a particularly tense scenario and the player(s) must navigate the challenge. This usually involves player(s) needing to make a series of successes in a short time period. During an Epic Event... The GM draws a TC related to a specific task during the event. The GM determines the total number of TCs and the amount of successes or failures needed to complete the Epic Event. One or more players may announce how they would attempt this task. The GM decides the relevant Attribute or Skill, so each player may apply the relevant modifier. The GM applies no modifier. Each player involved and the GM take turns drawing on this TC, looking for a Suited Hit. If a player succeeds first, this is a success for the party. If the GM succeeds first, this is a failure. This process repeats for each TC in the Epic Event. A player may not volunteer for sequential TCs. Just as in standard Checks, a failure may be associated with some drawbacks. Successive failures could change the course of the story. Fate Cards card mechanics still apply: played As return to the player\u2019s hand. Players may use Fate Cards for redraws. For example , an earthquake causes a cavern to shake. The party must act quickly to get out before a collapse The GM reveals a TC: a 4 of Hearts, with DR 4. How will the party navigate their way to safety? Xena and Elise both volunteer for this TC. Xena will attempt to remember the way back, and will be making Knowledge Checks. Elise is a skilled survivalist, with experience in rock formations, and will be making Craft Checks. Xena draws a 3 of Spades with +0 Mod. This is within the DR, but not a Suited Match. Elise draws a 9 of Hearts with a +1 Mod. This is a Suited Match, the group makes good headway. The GM reveals a new TC: a K of Spades, with DR 3. A cultist blocks their path. Genesis volunteers to distract the cultists, using Performance Checks. Genesis and the GM each draw: Genesis, then the GM, then Genesis, then the GM, etc. Finally, the GM draws a Q of Spades. The cultist sees the remaining party members. The GM reveals a new TC, DR 2. All party members must make Athletics checks to outrun the cultist. When a Dealer is Knocked Out in combat, their subsequent turns are replaced with Epic Event TCs of DR 4 Vitality Checks. If they take additional damage, they make these checks at Lower Hand (+1). If they succeed on two TCs, they remain unconscious and the Epic Event is concluded. For a Major Success (same value as TC), they recover 1 HP. For a Critical Success, they recover 1 HP and up to 3 FP (FP max permitting). If they fail two of these TCs, they are called to the great beyond. Rests Rests are common throughout a session. There are two types of rests. A Quick Rest represents a short 30-minute break, where characters may be catching their breath or healing their wounds. A Full Rest is an 8-hour period of time where characters get some sleep and recover from a long day. During a Quick Rest, each player who is resting draw from their deck using Rest Cards. Players start with a number of Rest Cards equal to the sum of their maximum Health and Fate Points. Each Rest Cards drawn regains 1 Health or Fate Point. If the card drawn is the same as the players's Primary Suit, regain an additional 1 Health or Fate Point. To recover Armor Points, a player may expend one Rest Card to make a Craft or Knowledge Skill check of DR 7 minus the number of points they are attempting to recover. If the Rest Card drawn matches they player's Primary Suit, make this check at Upper Hand. For standard play, Shuffle your discard pile back into your deck after completing a Quick Rest. For hardcore play, continue without shuffling. After completing a Full Rest, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck, along with any Aces from your hand. Add both Jokers to your hand as Fate Cards if they were used. Fate, Health, and Armor Points all return to their maximum. Rest Cards return to their full value after a Full Rest. If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may shuffle and always draw with the Lower Hand when making a check. This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day. Primary Suit Each Dealer has a connection to a Primary Suit, as suggested by their Role. In addition to impacting Quick Rest recoveries, Dealers may discard cards as a Minor Action for additional benefits in combat starting at Level 2. For 2 cards discarded, up to a limit of 4, an Upper/Lower Hand +1 is granted described below. These effects do not stack; only one may be applied to a character at a time. Clubs \u2663\ufe0f, Aggro: Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits. They can choose to bury N cards to force all creatures within 2 spaces to make their next Check to attack targets besides the Defense Dealer at Lower Hand (N/2). Diamonds \u2666\ufe0f, Intensify: Casters Dealers have explosive damage but they run out of gas really fast. They can choose to burn N cards to make their next Check at Upper Hand (N/2). Hearts \u2665\ufe0f, Help: Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they are within 6 spaces of an ally, they may toss 2 cards to grant their ally Upper Hand(N/2) on their next draw. Spades \u2660\ufe0f, Thwart: Offense Dealers deploy all sorts of mechanisms for drawing the eye of enemies away from their allies. They can scrap N cards and cause an enemy to make Checks at Lower Hand (N/2) until the start of the Offense Dealer's next turn. The discard limit increases with level according to the table below. Level Discard Cap Bonus 1 4 2 5 6 3 8 8 4 Character Creation Deck of Adventures offers both premade characters and a completely customizable process. Consult with your GM for information about the setting and what skills will be relevant for the story ahead. Custom creation starts with spending Experience Points on Attributes, Skills, Powers, Vulnerabilities and/or Skills. A Background is descriptive about of character's history and where they are when you begin your adventure. A Role is a general class the unlocks access to certain abilities. Attributes cost more, but also increase corresponding skills. Spending points has diminishing returns. Going from 0 to +1 is relatively cheap, but +3 to +4 will take many more points. Skill Modifiers start unskilled with a 0 Modifier, so choose carefully. Vulnerabilities are roleplay and/or combat weaknesses and yield 1 or 2 additional Experience Points to spend when they are added to the Character Sheet during Character Creation. Powers are special features, boons or strengths, that cost 1 or 2 points. Powers may have additional requirements such as Role or Level. For a full set of character creation options, see our Character Creation page . Starting your adventure There are four steps to starting an adventure of Deck of Adventures: Find a group: Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master ( GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to the table. Join the Deck of Adventures Discord Server ! to find a group! If the above link is expired, please submit an issue . Discuss play style: Different players and GMs will have different preferences. Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided. Choose your adventure: You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures\u2019s standard adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited to make modifications to fit their setting. Pick a time and place: Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20 because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily. To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind... Schedules: Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving forward. Getting on the same page: A good \u2018first\u2019 session discussion topic is the story ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the first official session of play. Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and your's to remember.","title":"Full Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#deck-of-adventures-core-mechanics","text":"","title":"Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#full-players-guide","text":"","title":"Full Player's Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#table-of-contents","text":"What is a Tabletop Game System?

A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like the circles around the bullseye.

A Modifier is the maximum value a player may add or subtract; this is usually done to get closer to the TC. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet next to the relevant Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a character's ability to 'aim' a check to get closer to the TC.

This is how our voices spread through the heavens. Once known as \u201cBeedle Bards,\u201d Storytellers have taken shape all throughout the known Cosmiverse. Respected and honored, Storytellers are welcome at every hearth and home, every tavern and table, for the joyful company they bring. They tell of adventures, and entertain those around them by allowing them to live, for a time, within those adventures. Storytellers are known wide and far for their ability, some even call it Magic, to weave a story between multiple listeners and spectators and for them to feel they have lived those adventures for themselves. This is the magic you might wield, oh reader. Guides may lie ahead, but the true spirit must come from deep within you. Humbly, Duke Beedle of Pelagia As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of adventurers and guide them through a Story of Pelagia. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends Virtually through ExampleWebsite.com or in the Discord. If you\u2019ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what\u2019s different about being a Game Master of Pelagia, you can skip right to Section 3, \u201cWhat it\u2019s all about\u201d. For everyone else, or those Game Masters who want a refresher, we\u2019ll dive into what being a Game Master is all about in Section 2: \u201cGetting Started\u201d.

Classically, this is a 'racial' or species origin (e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport, your character might be more adept at sailing (i.e., certain skill checks) than others. Coming to a new land as an outsider might be a Vulnerability , as described below. Characters beginning their journey at level 1 are relatively unskilled. They may have had one profession for many years, but should not have any significant experience adventuring or traveling beyond the borders of the comfort zone shared by their peers. Choose Your Role Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might apply force, a Caster might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Role grants you access to specific upgrades, called Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must forfeit Powers with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent. Defender Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess with! Primary Skill: Brute Suggested Suit: Clubs \u2663\ufe0f / Defense \ud83d\udee1 Support Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the support of our friends. Primary Skill: Craft Suggested Suit: Hearts \u2665\ufe0f / Life \u2764\ufe0f\u200d Martial Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons to directly damage enemies. Agile and light on their feet! Primary Skill: Finesse Suggested Suit: Spades \u2660\ufe0f / Offense \ud83e\udd1b Caster Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techno-wizards of a much more mundane world. Their intellect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely comprehend. Primary Skill: Knowledge Suggested Suit: Diamonds \u2666\ufe0f / Conjuring \u26a1\ufe0f Using Experience Points (XP) Both at character creation (6) and at the GM's discretion for each level up (3), you are awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an Attribute, a Skill, or remove a Vulnerability. Total XP is equal to 6 + (level * 3). DM permitting, you may respec, or exchange powers for their equivalent XP value. Choose Your Powers Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield, covering simple abilities like swinging a weapon to complicated magical feats. Some Powers require a specific Role, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill Modifiers. Each Power has an associated XP cost. Passive mechanics, or Minor magical tricks typically cost 1 XP. Big, character-altering feats will cost more. Major Powers are tiresome and require a limited resource to use: Fate Points(FP). Each Power will list the range of FP that can be spent (e.g., 1 FP to target one enemy vs. 2 FP to target multiple). The more FP spent, the bigger the effect. Numbers separated by / in the mechanics description indicate different effects depending on FP spent. Adding a Power with an FP cost raises the character's maximum FP by the largest number of FP listed for that Power. FP are replenished on a Rest . Unless otherwise noted, Powers... 1. Take a Major Action to perform and use a Dealer's Primary Skill Modifier. 2. That have sustained effects, may only be used one at a time. Passive Powers take no action and are always in effect. 3. That damage, deal 1 point of damage. 4. That have implied range, may be used up to 6 spaces away. Choose Your Vulnerabilities People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship with the world. At character creation you can choose up to four Vulnerabilities, which add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim. Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 (Minor) or 2 (Major) Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability. Vulnerability types: Minor : Adds 1 XP Major : Adds 2 XP Some Vulnerabilities are either Minor or Major, depending on the effects you choose. Changing Attributes and Skills All Attributes and Skills start at a 0 Modifier. You can adjust your Skills and Attributes using your Experience Points (XP), which will help define how capable your character for relevant actions. On initial character creation, you can spend or earn points by increasing or decreasing Attributes and Skill Modifiers up to -2 or +2. This upper limit increases as you level up (see table below). Once modifiers are set at character creation, a player may only add newly awarded Experience points. Mod Cap by Level Level SkillCap 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 4 7 5 8 5 9 5 10 6 The lower limit for Modifiers is -2. If -1, any Check made with that modifier must be be a Color Match for success.

Flavor text that is included in under mechanics always be separable for future versions that will apply to different settings. To identify flavor text, use quotes within the parent formatting scheme. For example: The Defender Archetype is ... Defenders of Pelagia are renowned for their mighty shields ... Specialized terms are listed in the Glossary and will be capitalized across all documents. Terms that are for flavor, not mechanics, are Italicized Core Design Principles Deck of Adventures is, first and foremost, designed for accessibility , both in ease of on-boarding and ease of access. Not everyone has specialty dice or the time to study complex interconnected rules released over a long history. While becoming a Game Master (GM) may take some time and dedication, a player completely new to tabletop roleplaying should be able to pick up Deck of Adventures and start playing within an hour. This means mechanics should be easy to learn, and easy to explain during a first session. One only needs a standard deck of playing cards. Second, Deck of Adventures is designed to be flexible , across the many types of stories GMs want to tell. While our mechanics have been work shopped with lore from the World of Pelagia, all core mechanics should be portable to another setting. The flavor text that surrounds mechanics will change beyond Pelagia, but the features themselves should stay the same. Third, participants should be able to quickly and easily engage in rich storytelling with only a standard deck of playing cards. Any component that doesn't contribute to this end should be revisited. Accessible and flexible doesn't, however, mean sparse. A first-time player can pick up a pre-made character in minutes, but then optionally spend much longer planning out how to make a bespoke character that speaks to them, with creativity fueled by the wide array of choices. Design Axioms Though itterative design, developers have landed on the following as touchstones. Pip value is contextual. The number on the card has no inherent value. There's nothing good or bad about a 2 or a King , a Spade or a Club . The randomized context determines how good the outcome is. FP = HP = AP. During rests, players decide which of these reources to replenish. Characters may have different maximum, but expending one should feel roughly equivalent to the others.","title":"Design"},{"location":"2_Development/02_Design_Document/#design-document","text":"","title":"Design Document"},{"location":"2_Development/02_Design_Document/#drafting-specifics","text":"The following are not permitted in filenames: () {} [] !@#$%^&* ' ` and spaces.
