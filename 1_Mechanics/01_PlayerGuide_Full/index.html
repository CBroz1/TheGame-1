<h2 id="what-is-a-tabletop-game-system">What is a Tabletop Game System?</h2>
<p>A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are
used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game
session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage
for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM
presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the
game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player’s success and failure, and
guides the group in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when
starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things.
Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds
Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can
be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself
apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards.
While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action,
Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck.</p>
<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>In times of uncertainty, defer to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have fun. </li>
<li>The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to ensure the 
entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and will work 
to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-action-deck">The Action Deck</h2>
<p>Deck of Adventures is based around a 54-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A)
across 4 suits, as well as Jokers. Each player should have their own Deck. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a Check, which means 
drawing from their respective decks to help determine the outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jokers and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, for both players
and the GM. All other cards go directly into a Discard Pile. Hold on to these Fate
Cards, even when shuffling the deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players will use their deck to do most anything; it represents their character's
stamina until they complete a Rest. When the Action Deck is empty and a player has to
shuffle between rests, they draw with the 
<a href="#Upper-and-Lower-Hand">Lower Hand (1+)</a> until they would shuffle when resting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fate-cards">Fate Cards</h2>
<p>Fate Cards (Jokers and Aces) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player
to choose when they want a second chance at a key moment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After a Full Rest, Jokers return to the player's hand as Fate Cards, if they're not
there already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aces drawn from the deck are played as usual, but remains in the player's hand as a
Fate Card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any time a player or the GM draws a card, they may discard one held Fate Card and 
redraw. Only one redraw is permitted per check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fate Cards may also be expended to either ... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Toughen Up</em>: ignore damage equal to the number of Fate Cards used. This must be
   done before the end of the Player's next turn after recieving damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Exchange Fate</em>: gain Fate Points equal to the number of Fate Cards used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the player's discard pile or signified by
another token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character’s
strengths or weaknesses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
<h3 id="attributes-skills-and-modifiers">Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers</h3>
<ol>
<li>Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and
weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality.</li>
<li>Skills are specific to an Attribute. These signify how good a character is at
performing certain types of actions. Each Skill is tied to an Attribute, meaning
improving that Attribute also increases the effectiveness of a related Skill.
Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a Conviction skill. All Attributes and
Skills are listed below.</li>
<li>Modifiers reflect a character’s level of expertise given Attribute or Skill domain 
and allow you to add or subtract your draw before reporting the value on a given check.
 These modifiers are determined at Character Creation and can be improved as you Level Up.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Complete Attribute and Skill List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agility AGL<ul>
<li>Finesse (Fight)</li>
<li>Stealth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conviction CON</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluffing</li>
<li>Performance
   <!-- - Persuasion --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intuition GUT</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detection
   <!-- - Faith --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craft
   <!-- - Naturalism --></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligence INT</p>

<li>Brute (Fight)
   <!-- - Intimidation --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vitality VIT</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each skill is generally related to a domain of expertise a character may possess. A GM
might call for a Check using a specific Skill, but you can always ask if another 
would be applicable in the situation. The GM decides whether the Skill applies, so get
creative! </p>
<!--Add some examples of specific skills being used, with general description of domain -->

<h3 id="dealers-bystanders-and-companions">Dealers, Bystanders and Companions</h3>
<p>The Player Characters (PCs) are typically the heroes of the story. PCs are
considered Dealers and differ from the majority of other characters in the world. The
GM may control other Dealers who can take the form of powerful allies or adversaries
the players may encounter along the way. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters that are controlled by
the Game Master. They...</p>
<ul>
<li>Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Have at least 5 health points (HP).</li>
<li>Draw from their own deck of cards.</li>
<li>Can receive and use Fate Cards.</li>
<li>Have a Primary Suit, and related mechanics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bystanders. All other characters. They...</p>
<ul>
<li>Are weaker than Dealers</li>
<li>Have limited access to Powers</li>
<li>Have 1-3 HP.</li>
<li>Draw from a collective set of cards controlled by the GM. </li>
<li>Cannot use either Fate Cards or Primary Suit features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or
other-worldly advisor. A Companion acts on the players turn, draws from the Dealer's
deck of cards, and grants unique features in and out of combat. See the setting
Bestiary for a list of potential Companions and their unique features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
<h3 id="exploration-and-adventuring">Exploration and Adventuring</h3>
<p>The players are creating and experiencing the world at the same time. Adventures can
include exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging in social
interactions with other players and non-playable characters. During an Adventure, the
GM will ask players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier
relevant to the circumstance.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setting the Scene.</strong> The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events
and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players
are encouraged to ask clarifying questions.</li>
<li><strong>What do I see?</strong> Characters often know more just by having direct access to the
world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a
character might have. The GM’s answer may depend on a successful check.</li>
<li><strong>Talking to the Locals.</strong> The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will
respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks
may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or
other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse
to be rude to one’s fellow players.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="making-a-check">Making a Check</h3>
<p>When the GM or a Player calls for a Check, they announce who will be making this check
and reveal (a) a Target Card (TC), (b) the Attribute or Skill associated with the
check, and (c) the Difficulty Range (DR). </p>
<p>A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The
Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like
the circles around the bullseye. </p>
<p>Once the DR has been announced, players must make this check. Players may consult with
their GM to determine if another Attribute or Skill may be used instead. A player will
draw one or more cards. Immediately after drawing, a player will apply any relevant
Modifiers before reporting the outcome and whether or not they have successfully fallen
within the DR. A Modifier is the maximum value a player may add or subtract; this is
usually done to get closer to the TC. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet
next to the relevant Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a
character's ability to 'aim' a check to get closer to the TC. </p>
<p>The GM may describe the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success and ask
the player to describe how their character successfully accomplishes the action. </p>
<p>Because the range of cards is circular (Q, K, A, 2, 3, etc.), success is all about
dialing in your effort to match the task at hand as closely as possible. Remembering
which card is 5 below a 3 can be tough, so there is a table below as well as a
<a href="../Circlular_TC-DR_Tool/">printable tool</a> to help look up the DR range as you
get familiar with the system.</p>
<p><strong>Target Card Range Table</strong>
For each card on the left, refer to the column with the corresponding DR. 
Left of 0 is the lower bound, right of 0 is the upper bound.</p>

<h4 id="degrees-of-success">Degrees of Success</h4>
<p>Exactly matching the TC in numeric value, is a Major Success. If the drawn card is a
perfect match (i.e., value and suit), it's a Critical Success. If the card drawn is
within the DR and matches the suit or color (i.e., red/black), it is either a Suited or
Color Success. If there is a suit or color match outside the DR after the modifier has
been applied, this is a Suited or Color Miss. Suit and Color will only matter under
specific circumstances; for certain character Powers, item types or defenses. There is
no critical failure in Deck of Adventures.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, when Xena attempts to jump across a chasm, the GM reveals a TC of
the 8 of Clubs and a DR of 2, asking for an Athletics check. If the player's Athletics 
modifier is +1, the check is ...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Critical Success if they draw the 8 of Clubs. They might perfectly make the
 jump, impressing their allies, and catch a glimpse of something important in the 
 distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Major Success if they draw any 8. They might make the jump gracefully enough to 
impress their allies without any other perks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Success if they draw any card within 3 (DR 2 ± 1 Mod). For TC 8, DR 1, and Mod 1, 
this is 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 or J. If Xena draws a J, they may subtract 1 to report a 10, 
within the DR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Color Success for any Successes that match the color of the TC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Suited Success for any Successes that match the Suit of the TC. Xena might have a 
Power that grants benefits to allies on a Suited Success. After crossing, they can 
improve their ally's chances of crossing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Suited or Color Miss if they draw any Club or Spade, respectively below 5 or above
J. Xena might have a Power that lets them redraw on a Suited Miss, for example. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Miss is any Diamond or Heart draw below 5 or above J.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="upper-and-lower-hand">Upper and Lower Hand</h4>
<p>Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Having the Upper Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card 
closest to the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A player may choose to stop 
drawing before N cards are drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having the Lower Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card that 
is furthest from the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A play must draw all N
cards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In these cases, the other card is discarded. If N is not specified, draw 1 extra.
Multiple Upper/Lower hand effects can compound or even out. If a rule specifies
Upper/Lower Hand (N+), the effect can apply multiple times. N cards are drawn, +1 for
each instance the effect is applied. For example, running through your Action Deck
without resting is Lower Hand (1+). This means that, if it happens twice, draw 3. If
another effect would also cause drawing with Lower Hand, draw 4.</p>
<h4 id="contested-checks">Contested Checks</h4>
<p>Some checks will be initiated by a character's actions and require others to respond,
pitting two skills against each other. This might be one character sneaking past
another (e.g., Stealth vs. Detection), or one character causing a magical effect that
another tries to dodge (e.g., Craft vs. Agility). This is a Contested Check. In these
cases, the character who initiated the action (i.e., the Attacker) reveals a TC and
sets the DR; the DR for a Contested Check is 3 minus half of the Attacker's relevant
modifier, to a minimum of 0. The character(s) responding are the Target(s). Rules that
describe a 
"Contested X Check vs. Y" use the attacker's Skill X and Targets' Y. Targets succeed or
fail individually.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> Xena attempts to convince Jonas of something (either truthfully or
with deception), they would use their Bluffing Mod of +1, setting the DR to 3 (4-1). 
They draw a TC of 3 of Diamonds, permitting a card between A and 6. Jonas draws an 8 of 
Spades with a +1 Modifier to Detection and reports a 7, still outside the DR. Xena would 
successfully convince Jonas of something in this scenario. </p>
<h3 id="in-combat">In Combat</h3>
<p>Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. The GM
decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. Combat in Deck
of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while leaving a lot of room for player
teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players should be sure to study their
character sheets and know their options ahead of combat, and use others’ turns to make
their choices. Deck of Adventures is all about teamwork, so communication is encouraged.</p>
<p>GMs may provide a grid map and other visual cues like character tokens to help players
visualize the situation. On a square grid, moving diagonally counts as one space unless
otherwise ruled by the GM.</p>
<p>In combat, a Critical Success has an additional effect. Damaging or Healing actions deal
or return 1 additional damage to the target. Other actions will grant benefits at the
GM's discretion.</p>
<h4 id="taking-turns">Taking Turns</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Combat order is determined by card draw. At the beginning of combat, all characters
draw a Target Card and place it in on the table in view. The values represent the turn
order (Ace first, then K, Q, etc.) and the TC for any attack. Players with the same
Target Card values as an enemy go first. If two players draw the same Target Card, they
can decide who goes first. Without consensus, the player with the higher Agility
modifier goes first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player may delay their turn in initiative order to intentionally occur before or
after another player(s)', but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their
action(s) by the end of the round. A GM may skip a player’s turn if they are unprepared
and need more time to think.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="in-combat-actions">In Combat Actions</h4>
<p>Each turn represents 6 seconds of game time passing. On a turn, a character may
(a) move, (b) perform 1 Major Action, and/or (c) perform 1 Minor Action in any order
they choose. They may also perform any number of Free Actions, within reason, as
permitted by the GM.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Movement</strong> By default, character speed is equal to 6, but may be faster or slower.
Speed is the total number of spaces a character can move in a turn. This total may be 
split to occur before, after, and/or between actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> The list below are possible Minor/Major Actions, but a GM may permit
others. If an action specifies a skill, this requires a check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free</strong>
        - <em>Communication</em> that does not require a check.
        - <em>Observation</em>: gaining obvious information about the world.
        - <em>Toughening Up</em>: discard one or more Fate Cards to nullify one damage per card
         used.
        - <em>Exchanging Fate</em>: discard one or more Fate Cards to gain one Fate Point per 
        card used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor</strong>
        - <em>Object interaction</em>: Pressing a button, pulling a lever, using a disposable
       item, etc.
        - <em>Inspect</em>: Detection or Investigation vs. GM-determined DR; learn something
         about an opponent or the terrain.
        - <em>Convince</em>: Bluffing vs. GM-determined DR; convince a target to change their
         course of action
        - <em>Recall</em>: Knowledge vs. GM-determined DR; determine if a character knows a
         specific piece of information </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major</strong>
        - <em>Rush</em>: double movement
        - <em>Grapple</em>: Brute vs. target Finesse or Brute; cause one creature to be entangled
        - <em>Hide</em>: Stealth vs. target(s) Detection; impose Lower Hand on attacks against
         you by target(s) who failed</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="status-conditions">Status Conditions</h4>
<p>Some Status Conditions will impact a character over time. The duration of each Condition
is listed in the Power or effect that causes it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Stunned</strong> If a Dealer is hit by a critical attack, they make a DR 3 Conviction
Check at the start of their turn vs their  own TC. If failed, they may either move or
make one Action on their turn, not both. Some creatures can cause the Stunned Condition
as part of their attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entangled</strong> A Dealer may expend a Major Action to make a DR 3 Strength check. Until
they are successful, they may not move and any Agility Checks are made with Lower
Hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knocked Down</strong> A Dealer must expend a Minor Action to get up. Their movement speed
is halved, rounding up. All Strength and Agility Checks are made with Lower Hand. When
Knocked Down, attackers within 1 space draw with Upper Hand and attackers further than
1 space away draw with Lower Hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blinded, Deafened</strong> At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a
DR 3 Intuition Check vs. their TC. If they fail, they draw Lower Hand (3) for any
action requiring the relevant sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knocked Out</strong> Knocked Out (KO) Dealers are unable to act until treated by a Craft
check or a Healing Power (DR 5 vs. the KO Dealer's TC, minus 1 for each turn passed
since the effect onset). If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, the player begins
an Epic Event alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Burned</strong> As a Minor Action, a Dealer can make a DR 3 Intuition check to stop the
burning. On a failure, they take 1 damage bypassing AP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Poisoned</strong> At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a DR 3
Vitality Check to shake off the effects of the poison. On a failure, they take 1 damage
bypassing AP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frozen</strong> Movement speed is reduced by half and all skill checks are drawn at Lower
Hand. A Dealer makes a DR 3 Strength Check as a Free Action at the end of their turn to
attempt to end the freeze.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="health-and-armor">Health and Armor</h3>
<p>Dealers have 4 health points (HP) plus their level, plus Vitality modifier. The health
of Companions HP is half the level of their Dealer, rounding up. If a character is
wounded beyond their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor Points (AP) are an
additional resource that would be removed first in the event of a physical wound. </p>
<p>Armor Range (AR) is how hard you are to hit in general and sets the DR for an attack
against you. Without armor, this is 3 minus half of your Agility modifier rounded down.
If you have physical armor or an armor-like magical effect, this determines your AR
depending on the type of armor. Some armor has strength requirements which, if unmet,
will cut a character's speed in half. Some armor can possess special effects, like
granting bonuses to certain checks or requiring hits to color-match.</p>
<p>Physical shields and magical effects
can grant AP, either when equipping the item or activating the Power. Unless otherwise
specified, damage subtracts from AP first. After AP is
depleted, additional damage subtracts from HP. Unless otherwise noted, no two pieces of 
armor may be worn at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Table</strong>
| Type      | AR | AP | Prerequisite  |
|-----------|----|----|---------------|
| Basic     | 3  | 0  |               |
| Light     | 3  | 0  |               |
| Medium    | 2  | 0  |               |
| Fortified | 2  | 1  | Strength ≥ 0  |
| Heavy     | 1  | 2  | Strength ≥ 1  |
| Massive   | 1  | 3  | Strength ≥ 2  |
| Gleaming  | 1  | 2  | Agility ≥ 3   |</p>
<h3 id="epic-events">Epic Events</h3>
<!-- Add Knocked Out details -->

<p>At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event. The GM will narrate a particularly
tense scenario and the player(s) must navigate the challenge. This usually involves
player(s) needing to make a series of successes in a short time period. During an Epic
Event...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The GM draws a TC related to a specific task during the event. The GM determines the
total number of TCs and the amount of successes or failures needed to complete the Epic
Event. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One or more players may announce how they would attempt this task. The GM decides the
relevant Attribute or Skill, so each player may apply the relevant modifier. The GM
applies no modifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each player involved and the GM take turns drawing on this TC, looking for a Suited
Hit. If a player succeeds first, this is a success for the party. If the GM succeeds
first, this is a failure. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process repeats for each TC in the Epic Event. A player may not volunteer for
sequential TCs. Just as in standard Checks, a failure may be associated with some
drawbacks. Successive failures could change the course of the story. Fate Cards card
mechanics still apply: played As return to the player’s hand. Players may use Fate
Cards for redraws.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, an earthquake causes a cavern to shake. The party must act quickly
  to get out before a collapse</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The GM reveals a TC: a 4 of Hearts, with DR 4. How will the party navigate their way
to safety?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xena and Elise both volunteer for this TC. Xena will attempt to remember the way
back, and will be making Knowledge Checks. Elise is a skilled survivalist, with
experience in rock formations, and will be making Craft Checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xena draws a 3 of Spades with +0 Mod. This is within the DR, but not a Suited
   Match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elise draws a 9 of Hearts with a +1 Mod. This is a Suited Match, the group makes 
   good headway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GM reveals a new TC: a K of Spades, with DR 3. A cultist blocks their path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis volunteers to distract the cultists, using Performance Checks. Genesis and
the GM each draw: Genesis, then the GM, then Genesis, then the GM, etc. Finally, the GM
draws a Q of Spades. The cultist sees the remaining party members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GM reveals a new TC, DR 2. All party members must make Athletics checks to outrun
the cultist.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When a Dealer is Knocked Out in combat, their subsequent turns are replaced with Epic
Event TCs of DR 4 Vitality Checks. If they take additional damage, they make these
checks at Lower Hand (+1). If they succeed on two TCs, they remain unconscious and the
Epic Event is concluded. For a Major Success (same value as TC), they recover 1 HP. For
a Critical Success, they recover 1 HP and up to 3 FP (FP max permitting). If they fail
two of these TCs, they are called to the great beyond. </p>
<h3 id="rests">Rests</h3>
<p>Rests are common throughout a session. There are two types of rests. A Quick Rest
represents a short 30-minute break, where characters may be catching
their breath or healing their wounds. A Full Rest is an 8-hour period of time where
characters get some sleep and recover from a long day.</p>
<p>During a Quick Rest, each player who is resting draw from their deck using Rest Cards.
Players start with a number of Rest Cards equal to the sum of their maximum Health and
Fate Points. Each Rest Cards drawn regains 1 Health or Fate Point. If the card drawn is
the same as the players's Primary Suit, regain an additional 1 Health or Fate Point. To
recover Armor Points, a player may expend one Rest Card to make a Craft or Knowledge
Skill check of DR 7 minus the number of points they are attempting to recover. If the
Rest Card drawn matches they player's Primary Suit, make this check at Upper Hand. For
standard play, Shuffle your discard pile back into your deck after completing a Quick
Rest. For hardcore play, continue without shuffling.</p>
<p>After completing a Full Rest, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck, along
with any Aces from your hand. Add both Jokers to your hand as Fate Cards if they were
used. Fate, Health, and Armor Points all return to
their maximum. Rest Cards return to their full value after a Full Rest.</p>
<p>If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may shuffle and
always draw with the Lower Hand when making a check. This signifies your character
running out of Stamina during a long day. </p>
<h3 id="primary-suit">Primary Suit</h3>
<p>Each Dealer has a connection to a Primary Suit, as suggested by their Role. In addition
to impacting Quick Rest recoveries, Dealers may discard cards as a Minor Action for
additional benefits in combat starting at Level 2. For 2 cards discarded, up to a limit of 4, an
Upper/Lower Hand +1 is granted described below. These effects do not stack; only one
may be applied to a character at a time.</p>
<!-- Specifying in combat until we can revsit non-combat uses of agro and thwart -->

<ul>
<li>
<p>Clubs ♣️, Aggro: Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits.
  They can choose to <em>bury</em> N cards to force all creatures within 2 spaces to make
  their next Check to attack targets besides the Defense Dealer at Lower Hand (N/2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diamonds ♦️, Intensify: Casters Dealers have explosive damage but they run out of gas
  really fast. They can choose to <em>burn</em> N cards to make their next Check at Upper
  Hand (N/2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hearts ♥️, Help: Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they
  are within 6 spaces of an ally, they may <em>toss</em> 2 cards to grant their ally Upper
  Hand(N/2) on their next draw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spades ♠️, Thwart: Offense Dealers deploy all sorts of mechanisms for drawing the eye
  of enemies away from their allies. They can <em>scrap</em> N cards and cause an enemy to
  make Checks at Lower Hand (N/2) until the start of the Offense Dealer's next turn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The discard limit increases with level according to the table below.</p>

<li><strong>Find a group:</strong> Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master (
GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to the
table. Join the Deck of Adventures <a href="https://discord.gg/dk6RfWgPHF">Discord Server</a>! to find a group!</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Discuss play style:</strong> Different players and GMs will have different preferences.
Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve
political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch
horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to
give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose your adventure:</strong> You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures’s standard
adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described
here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited
to make modifications to fit their setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pick a time and place:</strong> Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played
in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20
because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Schedules:</strong> Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving
forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting on the same page:</strong> A good ‘first’ session discussion topic is the story
ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should
propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help
your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete
backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the
first official session of play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in
their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM
can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and your's to
remember.</p>
</li>
